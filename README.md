This code loads a pre-trained face detection classifier and initializes the webcam. It then loops through each frame of the webcam feed and performs face detection on each frame. The detectMultiScale() function is used to detect faces in each frame. The function returns a list of coordinates for each detected face in the format (x, y, w, h), where (x, y) is the top-left corner of the detected face and (w, h) are the width and height of the detected face. Finally, the code draws a rectangle around each detected face using the cv2.rectangle() function and displays the frame with the detected faces using the cv2.imshow() function.
